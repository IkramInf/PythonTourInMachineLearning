# Python Tour In Machine Learning

### Why you should read this book???

An easy and step by step implementation of machine learning problem is shown in python. You will find 6 machine learning problems and their step by step solutions. The problems are given below:<br>
[1] Prediction on iris plants dataset (data is taken from sklearn.datasets.load_iris()) <br>
[2] California Housing dataset (data is taken from sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing()) <br>
[3] Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster (kaggle link : https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic ) <br>
[4] House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques (kaggle link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques ) <br>
[5] An artificial dataset made by sklearn.datasets.make_blobs() to understand unsupervised learning
[6] Market basket analysis (kaggle link : https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python )

In chapter 1, some basic machine learning concepts is defined easily. <br>
In chapter 2, popular used python libraries is introduced. How to install, how to use etc. <br>
In chapter 3, Implementation of ML classification technique in iris plants dataset. <br>
In chapter 4, Implementation of ML regression technique in california housing dataset. <br>
In chapter 5, Prediction of survived and dead based on Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster data. <br>
In chapter 6, Training on House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques dataset. <br>
In chapter 7, A KMeans clustering model is built on artificial dataset to understand unsupervised learning. <br>
In chapter 8, Customer segmentation is performed by KMeans clustering technique.<br>

The following steps are implemented step by step as necessary in each problem: <br>
Data Preprocessing <br>
Checking data leakage <br>
Handling Categorical variables <br>
Handling missing values <br>
Handling class imbalance <br>
Building model and prediction <br>
Cross validation <br>
Various Evaluation technique <br>
Besides these, best feature selection technique, plotting decision region boundary etc will be found also. <br>
